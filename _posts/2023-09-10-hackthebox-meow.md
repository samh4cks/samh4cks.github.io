## TL;DR

This writeup is based on the [__Meow__](https://app.hackthebox.com/starting-point){:target="_blank"} machine, which is an easy-rated Linux box on Hack the Box. I began by scanning the target and found an open `Telnet port (23)`. After enumerating the service, I attempted logging in with common usernames and blank passwords. While `admin` and `administrator` failed, I successfully accessed the system using the `root` account with no password. With root access, I retrieved the flag and completed the challenge.


## Scanning Network

I began by performing an Nmap scan, which revealed open ports 23 , corresponding to telnet. Here are the results from Nmap scan:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -A -T4 -Pn -oN scan/normal.scan 10.129.223.201
Nmap scan report for 10.129.223.201
Host is up (0.22s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
23/tcp open  telnet  Linux telnetd
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

## Enumeration

`Telnet` is a network protocol that enables remote communication with devices using a text-based interface over TCP, typically on port `23`. It allows users to access and manage systems but transmits data in plaintext, making it insecure. Due to its lack of encryption, Telnet has largely been replaced by SSH for secure remote access. However, it is still useful for testing network services, checking open ports, and interacting with protocols like HTTP and SMTP.

While doing some Google searches on this protocol, I found out that it is an old service used for the remote management of other hosts on the network.  

Since the target is running this service, it can receive Telnet connection requests from other hosts on the network.  

Connection requests through Telnet are configured with a combination of a username and password for increased security.

```bash
telnet 10.129.223.201 23
Trying 10.129.223.201...
Connected to 10.129.223.201.
Escape character is '^]'.

I have to find some credentials to continue the work since I don't have any other ports on the target.

Sometimes due to configuration issue, some important accounts can be left without a passwords. We can brute force some typical important account such as `admin`, `administrator`,`root` with blank password.

```bash
telnet 10.129.223.201 23
Trying 10.129.223.201...
Connected to 10.129.223.201.
Escape character is '^]'.

## Exploitation

The first two try were unlucky. Let's try `root` account for login.

```bash
 telnet 10.129.223.201 23
Trying 10.129.223.201...
Connected to 10.129.223.201.

I have successfully logged in as `root` user in target machine. So, let's read the flag now.

```bash
root@Meow:~# ls
flag.txt  snap
root@Meow:~# cat flag.txt

root@Meow:~# exit
```
