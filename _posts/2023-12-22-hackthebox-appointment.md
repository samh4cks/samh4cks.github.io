## TL;DR

This writeup is based on the [__Appointment__](https://app.hackthebox.com/starting-point){:target="_blank"} machine, an easy-rated Linux box on Hack The Box. After scanning the target, I found that port `80` was open, running `Apache httpd 2.4.38`. Visiting the website revealed a login page, so I performed directory fuzzing but found no useful files. I then attempted common login credentials but was unsuccessful. Next, I tested for SQL injection vulnerabilities and found that the login form was vulnerable. Using a simple SQL injection payload, I bypassed authentication and gained access, revealing a flag on the webpage.

## Scanning Network

I began by performing an Nmap scan, which revealed open port `80`, corresponding to `Apache httpd 2.4.38`. Here are the results from the Nmap scan:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -A -T4 -Pn 10.129.12.234 -oN scan/normal.scan
Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-02-16 16:09 IST
Nmap scan report for 10.129.12.234
Host is up (0.21s latency).

```

## Enumeration

Let's visit `http://10.129.12.234/`.

![Target Site](/assets/images/starting-point/Appointment-HTB/1.png)

I came across a login page, so before investigating the login form, I will start directory fuzzing.

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.129.12.234/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-directories-lowercase.txt -o gobuster.dir-fuzz

I didn't find any interesting directories or files during directory fuzzing, so let's now investigate the login page.

## Exploitation

The first step in attacking a login page is to test for weak or default credentials such as:

```plaintext
admin:admin
admin:password
administrator:password
root:root
```

After attempting all the above combinations, I was still unable to log in. The next logical step is to test for **SQL Injection** vulnerabilities.

![SQL Query](/assets/images/starting-point/Appointment-HTB/2.png)

Since the website is likely built using PHP, we can try SQL injection payloads in the username and password fields to check if they are vulnerable.

In PHP, the `#` symbol is used to comment out the rest of a SQL query. This can be exploited to bypass authentication.

![username vulnerable to SQL](/assets/images/starting-point/Appointment-HTB/3.png)

After submitting the form, we get a page like this:

![Flag](/assets/images/starting-point/Appointment-HTB/4.png)

Successfully, I have got the flag.
