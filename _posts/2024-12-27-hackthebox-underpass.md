## TL:DR

This writeup is based on the [__UnderPass__](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/UnderPass){:target="_blank"} machine, an easy-rated Linux box on Hack The Box. I began by scanning the target and found open ports for SSH, HTTP, and SNMP. Enumerating SNMP revealed the hostname `UnderPass.htb`, which led me to the `Daloradius` management tool. Through directory fuzzing, I found the login panel and used default credentials to access the operators dashboard. Inside, I found an MD5-hashed password for `svcMosh`, which I cracked and used to gain SSH access. Checking sudo -l, I discovered that `mosh-server` could be executed as root. By leveraging mosh-server and its session key, I escalated privileges and gained root access.

## Scanning Network

I started with an Nmap scan, which revealed open ports `22` and `80` running `OpenSSH` and `Apache httpd 2.4.52`.

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -A -T4 -Pn 10.10.11.48 -oN scan/normal.scan
Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-02-09 13:33 IST

```
Two services, SSH and HTTP, were detected. Letâ€™s proceed with enumeration of the HTTP service.

## Enumeration

Let's browse to `http://10.10.11.48`.

![Browser view](/assets/images/writeups/UnderPass-HTB/1.png)

Let's begin directory fuzzing to identify any hidden directories or parameters.

```bash
wfuzz -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-directories-lowercase.txt -u http://10.10.11.48/FUZZ --hc 404,403,502,504

```

Directory fuzzing did not reveal anything useful, including path traversal vulnerabilities, subdomains, or common Apache misconfigurations.

Let's look for open UDP ports using an Nmap scan.

### Open UDP Ports

```bash
sudo nmap -sS -sU -sV -T4 -n 10.10.11.48

```

While scanning for open UDP ports, I found the `SNMP` service running on port `161`.

Let's enumerate the `SNMP` service.

### SNMP (Port 161) service

I will be using `snmp-check` to extract detailed information about the target.

![snmp-check](/assets/images/writeups/UnderPass-HTB/2.png)

While analyzing the output, I found the hostname `UnderPass.htb` and `Daloradius` server is being used. Let's add the hostname to `/etc/hosts` against the target IP address. 

`daloRADIUS` is an open-source web-based management tool for FreeRADIUS, one of the most widely used RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) servers. It provides a graphical interface to manage and monitor user authentication, accounting, and billing in network environments.

While researching `Daloradius`, I found that it is possible to access the `Daloradius` server via `http://<hostname>/daloradius`, and its default credentials are `administrator:radius`. So, I will be performing directory fuzzing on `http://underpass.htb/daloradius`.

```bash
dirsearch -u http://underpass.htb/daloradius/ -x 403,400,404 -t 50

Let's examine the discovered URLs, starting with `.gitignore`.

![.gitignore](/assets/images/writeups/UnderPass-HTB/3.png)

The `.gitignore` file contains file paths that will be ignored and won't be tracked in the repository.

Let's now browse the `Dockerfile`.

![Dockerfile](/assets/images/writeups/UnderPass-HTB/4.png)

While checking all the fuzzed URLs, I found the `/app` directory, which seems interesting. So, I will now fuzz the `/app` directory.

```bash
dirsearch -u http://underpass.htb/daloradius/app/ -x 403,400,404 -t 50 -o ~/Documents/HTB/Machines/UnderPass/dirsearch_underpass_app

Task Completed
```

I found two login pages while directory fuzzing, so let's browse them.

![/users & /operator](/assets/images/writeups/UnderPass-HTB/5.png)

As I have found two login pages, `/users/` and `/operators/` respectively, I will be utilizing the default credentials of the `Daloradius` server on both login pages.

I used the default credentials `administrator:radius` for both the `/users/` and `/operators/` login portals, but the login was successful only for the `operators` portal.

![Operator's Dashboard](/assets/images/writeups/UnderPass-HTB/6.png)

I successfully logged in as `operators`. While browsing the portal, I came across a list of users under `User Management`.

![User Management](/assets/images/writeups/UnderPass-HTB/7.png)

The password for `svcMosh` is stored as an MD5 hash in plaintext. I will use an online tool to crack the password.

![Crackstation](/assets/images/writeups/UnderPass-HTB/8.png)

After successfully cracking `svcMosh`'s password, I attempted to log in via SSH.

![svcMosh's shell](/assets/images/writeups/UnderPass-HTB/9.png)

## Post Exploitation

I will run `sudo -l` to check the list of commands that the current user can execute with elevated privileges using sudo.

![sudo -l](/assets/images/writeups/UnderPass-HTB/10.png)

I have found that the `Mosh` server is available and can be utilized without a password.

`Mosh (Mobile Shell)` is a remote terminal application that provides better performance than SSH, especially over unreliable or high-latency connections. The mosh-server process is a key component of Mosh, running on the remote machine and handling session management. It's an alternative to SSH.

I read the manual of `mosh-server` since I was interacting with it for the first time. I learned that it provides a session key and a specific port to connect with.

Let's run the `mosh-server`.

![mosh-server](/assets/images/writeups/UnderPass-HTB/11.png)

I found the session key and port to connect with the Mosh server. While researching, I came across a method to utilize the session key to connect to the local Mosh server using the specified port and session key.

![mosh-client](/assets/images/writeups/UnderPass-HTB/12.png)

I tried connecting to the localhost's Mosh server on port `6002` using the session key, and I gained root access.
